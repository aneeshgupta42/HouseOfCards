- [This Medium article]("https://medium.com/@Colin_But/define-testing-strategy-using-the-testing-pyramid-1dabee37e823")

### Running the Program
- Run `Main.main()` to run the program. A SplashScreen pops up and use it to choose any game of your choice. 

- Main class: Main

- Data files needed: All have been provided. The Data files would be the background images, the card texts, the cards and the other background colors we are using

- Features implemented: 5 games have been implemented. All support multiple player except Solitaire as it is a single player game in general.



### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:

Interesting data files:

- Known Bugs: A bug in Solitaire 

- Extra credit: 3 different extensions. Dark Mode is available, multiple windows and storing the high score for all the games. The high score for all the games can be displayed by clicking a button on the welcome screen.


### Impressions

- The project didn't seem hard at first but because of the virtual form and the time difference, we felt it was really hard to manage the whole project. Being able to meet in person is way more helpful than meeting virtually and working. 
- Keeping in sync with class concepts required to do this project was also a bit tough, due to the absence of labs and lectures like before.
